      "risk_assessment": "This clause is problematic because it implies unlimited liability without defining scope or fault, which may lead to unintended consequences for the vendor.",

  "summary": "Overall, this RFP presents moderate to high risk for the vendor due to the lack of clarity and flexibility in certain clauses, such as indemnification, termination, and payment terms. The RFP's requirements for confidentiality, non-collusion, and proposal format also present potential risks for the vendor. It is essential for the vendor to carefully review and negotiate these clauses to mitigate potential risks and ensure a successful partnership."
